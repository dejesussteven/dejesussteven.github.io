Theres so many ways to change the world. Solving a global or community issue, creating or contributing to an innovative solution, or making a positive change in the lives of others through support and outreach. Theres so many professions that create opportunities for peoples to make changes like these, but I'm especially drawn to the way web development paves the way for a brighter tomorrow not only for myself but for those I will have the opportunity to impact. Pursuing a career in web development won't put me in a position to diagnose and treat illnesses, bring change as a policy maker, or find a scientific solution to one of the world many issue, but what it will do is equip me with the skills to make an impact in one of those areas and many more. I consider having skills like that at my disposal as an incredible resource for the chaging world around me. When I think about my dreams as a web developer, I envision it as my opportunity to change the world through my work and influence others to see that they too can master these skills no matter when and where their starting point is...
